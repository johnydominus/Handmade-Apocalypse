  description: 'The global community has split: some believe the initiative is commendable,
    deserves encouragement, and will benefit world science; others argue that an
    aggressor remains an aggressor and simply wants to get its hands on cutting-edge
    developments to later use them to achieve its anti-democratic goals. In the end,
    science benefits, but everyone is on edge.'
