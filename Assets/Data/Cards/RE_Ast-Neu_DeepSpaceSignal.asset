  cardName: Undefined signal from deep space is received
  description: Radio telescopes aimed into the depths of space have picked up a signal.
    So far, it has not been possible to determine whether it is a meaningful message
    or merely a random stream of waves. But the event has already sparked public
    attention, including among deep-pocketed enthusiasts ready to pay a hefty sum
    to meet an alien civilization as soon as possible. On the other hand, most people
    remain skeptical, saying the aliens would destroy us and that all attempts to
    contact them should be stopped immediately.
